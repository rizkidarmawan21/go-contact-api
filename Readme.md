# Simple Contact API Project with Golang

In this project, I’m learning how to build a simple REST API using Golang. The use case is a contact management system. I’m using MySQL as the database, Gin as the web framework, and GORM as the ORM.

This project is part of my learning journey guided by mentor Tri Wicaksono
